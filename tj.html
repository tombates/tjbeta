<div id="helpDialog"  title="Getting Started with Thought Jot">

<h1 class="usage">About Thought Jot, and how to use it</h1>
<p class="usage">Welcome to Thought Jot, an online way to keep notes (jots) that 
sync across devices and that you can use to see different views of your notes on
different devices.</p>

<p class="usage">Thought Jot has a simple interface that supports jots with
text, links, and images. Each jot can have a title and tags attached to it,
along with its content. You can restrict or filter the jots you see using 
tags and date ranges. Link text will usually be detected and made into an
active hyperlink.</p>

<h1 class="usage">Restrictions</h1>
<p class="usage">Thought Jot requires full support of HTML5 IndexedDB. Unfortunately Safari still does not have
full IndexedDB support. Thought Jot works on recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.</p>

<h1 class="usage">First things first - telling Thought Jot where to store your jots</h1>
<p class="usage">Currently, Thought Jot stores your jots remotely using your Dropbox account. Of course, this can't be done without your permission. So before you can save your jots you need to tell the remote store you want to allow
Thought Jot to put things there. The only things Thought Jot will put there are the jots themselves, your current tags list, and
some bookkeeping data for the NimbusBase-based transport layer that stores jots to and retrieves jots from the remote storage location.</p>

  <h1 class="usageindented">Dropbox instructions</h1>
  <p class="usageindented">1. Create a Dropbox account if you don't already have one. Then, when you launch
  Thought Jot for the first time you should see a big button in the upper left with a red X through it.</p>
  <p class="usageindented">2. Click
  on that button and you should be asked by Dropbox to allow the creation of and access to a "tjbeta" folder
  on Dropbox. You might be presented with this dialog more than once. Just click "Allow" each time. This should
  not repeat more than three times.</p>
  <p class="usageindented">That's all there is to it. Sometimes however, even though you've done this it might
  take a while for the authorization to take effect.</p>

<h1 class="usage">Jotting</h1>
<p class="usage">New jots are composed in the text area at the top of the page. For the simplest jots, just type 
your content. When you click the plus button to the lower left of the entry area, the jot will be
added to the jots visible below the entry area.</p>
<p class="usage">You can also enter a title for your jot. If you don't enter a title, Thought Jot will create a title
from either the first 40 characters or the contents preceeding the first period, question mark or exclamation point or a
return, whichever is shortest. You can always edit the default title later. </p>
<p class="usage">You can also tag your jots by typing tags in the Tags field. Separate multiple tags with
commas. Tags can contain spaces. The merge button will add new tags to the tag selector list, making them available to use
in filtering. See the Tagging and Filtering sections for more information.</p>
<p class="usage">The displayed jots can be ordered with the newest or oldest jots at the top. Below the add button is
the re-order button. If you hover your pointer over it you will see the order you will get if you click it.
If you entered a new jot and didn't see it appear, you probably have oldest jots showing first and so the new one went to
the bottom.</p>

<h1 class="usage">Editing, Collapsing and Deleting Jots</h1>
<p class="usage">Any visible jot's content, title, and tags can be edited. To put a jot into editing mode 
click on the pencil on the left of the blue jot header. This will make the pencil turn into a check mark and
the editable areas will turn pink. When you are done editing click the check mark. Only one jot can be edited at a time.</p>
<p class="usage">You can collapse a jot to show only its blue header. You do this by clicking somewhere in the
blue header that is not directly on the title, tags, or datestamp regions. The same operation will expand a collapsed jot.</p>
<p class="usage">You can delete a jot by clicking the X on the right side of the blue jot header. You will be asked
to confirm the deletion. Currently, deleting a jot is not undoable.</p>


<h1 class="usage">Tagging</h1>
<p class="usage">You can attach tags to jots when you first make a new jot or later. Tags allow you to see a subset of all
your jots. You can select tags in the Tag Selector list (click for one tag, then ctrl-click to select more) and then
click the Stage Tags button. The selected tags will replace any tags in the Tags: text field below the Stage Tags button.
Alternatively you can just type tags into the Tags: text field. Tags can contain spaces but not commas and cannot start
with a dash or minus character (-). Multiple tags must be separated by commas.</p>
<p class="usage">At first there won't be any tags in your tag selector list. To add tags to the Tag Selector tag list, type
them in the Tags: text field and click the Merge button. If you want to remove a tag from your Tag Selector tag list then
type it in the Tags: text field preceeded by a minus sign (-) and when you hit Merge it will be removed if it is currently
in the tag list. This will remove the tag from remote storage, not just locally. It will not affect jots previously tagged
with the deleted tag(s). If you delete a tag by mistake, add it back by typing it in again and clicking the Merge button.</p>

<h1 class="usage">Filtering</h1>
<p class="usage">You can filter or restrict the jots that are displayed to subsets of all your jots. Currently you can
filter based on tags or date ranges.</p>
<p class="usage">To filter by tags, select the tags in the tag selector. Then check the "By Tags" checkbox under Filter
Options and 
select one of the options. Tags must exist in the tag selector list to be used in filtering. Use the merge button to
add a tag to the tag selector list.</p>
<p class="usage">To filter by dates check the "By Date Range" checkbox. Then click in either or both of the date fields to 
get a calendar. If you only provide one date you will only see jots made on that date. If you provide two dates (the order
is not important) you will see all jots created between the two dates.</p>
<p class="usage">Once you've set up your filtering criteria, click the Filter button. If you add a new jot that does not
meet the current filter criteria, it will still show. You can just click the Filter button again if you don't want it to
show.</p>

<h1 class="usage">Understanding where jots, tags and filters are stored</h1>
  <p class="usage">Jots are stored remotely. Currently this requires a Dropbox account. They might also be stored locally
  if the remote storage service is not available but the jots will be pushed to it when it becomes available. Assuming you are connected the jots will be stored or deleted in more or less real time.</p>
  <p class="usage">Your tags are also stored remotely. This means that all your tags are available regardless of what device or browser you are currently using Thought Jot on.</p>
  <p class="usage">Your filter settings are stored locally, specific to the device you are on and the browser brand you are using. Thought Jot stores your most recent filter criteria locally so that when you come back to the same device and use the same browser, the filter state will be restored to what it was previously. This means you could be working on one subset of your jots on one device (or browser) and another subset of your jots on another device or browser. But all the jots can be viewed on either device or browser just by turning all filtering off.</p>

<h1 class="usage">How Thought Jot works</h1>
<p class="usage">Thought Jot uses HTML5 IndexedDB for its local storage and the NimbusBase library to facilitate storage
and retrieval of jots and tags from your remote storage provider. Future versions will move away from the NimbusBase library.</p>
