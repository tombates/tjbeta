<div id="helpDialog"  title="Getting Started with Thought Jot">

<h1 class="usage">About Thought Jot, and how to use it.</h1>
<p class="usage">Welcome to Thought Jot, an online way to keep notes that 
sync across devices and that you can use to see different views of your notes on
different devices.</p>

<p class="usage">Thought Jot has a simple interface that supports jots with
text, links, and images. Each jot can have a title and tags attached to it,
along with its content. You can restrict or filter the jots you see using jot titles,
tags, and creation dates.</p>

<h1 class="usage">First Things First - telling Thought Jot where to store your jots.</h1>
<p class="usage">Thought Jot stores your jots remotely, using either your Dropbox account or your Google Drive account. Of course, this can't be done without your permission. So before you can save your jots you need to tell the remote store you want to allow
Thought Jot to put things there. The only things Thought Jot will put there are the jots themselves, your current tags list, and
some book keeping data for the NimbusBase based transport layer that stores jots to and retrieves jots from the remote storage location.</p>

  <h1 class="usageindented">Dropbox instructions:</h1>
  <p class="usageindented">Create a Dropbox account if you don't already have one. Then...</p>
  <p class="usageindented">...In your Dropbox account, navigate to </p>
  <h1 class="usageindented">Google Drive instructions: (OK, Actually that's not there yet)</h1>
  <p class="usageindented">Create a Google Drive account if you don't already have one. Then...</p>

<h1 class="usage">Jotting</h1>
<p class="usage">Jots are added using the text area at the top of the page. For the simplest jots just type in
your content. When you click the plus in a circle button to the lower left of the jot entry area the jot will be
added to the jots visible below the entry area.</p>
<p class="usage">The visible jots can be ordered with the newest or oldest jots at the top. Below the add button is
the re-order button. If you hover your mouse pointer over it it will tell you the new order you will get if you click it.
If you entered a new jot and didn't see it appear, you probably have oldest jots showing first and so the new one went to
the bottom. Another possiblity is that you added a jot which does not meet your current filter criteria and so it is not
shown.</p>
<p class="usage">If you want to give a jot a title you can enter
the title for it before you add it using the "Title:" field just below the jot entry area. You can always add a title later.
</p>

<h1 class="usage">Editing, Collapsing and Deleting Jots</h1>
<p class="usageindented">Any visible jot's content, title, and tags can be edited. To put a jot into editing mode just
click on the little pencil on the left of the blue header of the jot. This will make the pencil turn into a check mark and
the editable areas will turn pink. When you are done editing click the check mark. Only one jot can be edited at a time.</p>
<p class="usageindented">You can collapse a jot to show only its blue header. You do this by clicking somewhere in the
blue header that is not directly on the title, tags, or datestamp regions. The same operation will expand a collapsed jot.</p>
<p class="usageindented">You can delete a jot by clicking the X on the right side of the blue jot header. You will be asked
to confirm the deletion. Currently, deleting a jot is not undoable.</p>


<h1 class="usage">Tagging</h1>
<p class="usageindented">You can attach tags to jots, either when you first make a new jot or later. Tagging jots makes it
very easy to restrict your view of jots to just the ones that have certain tags. There are two ways to attach one or more
tags to a jot. You can select them in the Tag Selector list (click for one tag, then ctrl-click to select more) and then
click the Stage Tags button. The selected tags will be added to the Tags: text field below the Stage Tags button.
Alternatively you can just type tags into the Tags: text field. Tags can contain spaces but not commas and cannot start
with a dash or minus character (-). Multiple tags must be separated by commas.</p>
<p class="usageindented">To add tags to the Tag Selector tag list, type them in the Tags: text field and click the Merge
button. If you want to remove a tag from your Tag Selector tag list then type it in the Tags: text field preceeded by a minus
sign (-) and when you hit Merge it will be removed if it is currently in the tag list. This will remove the tag from remote
storage, not just locally. It will not affect jots previously tagged with the deleted tag(s). If you delete a tag by mistake,
add it back by typing it in again and clicking the Merge button.</p>

<h1 class="usage">Filtering</h1>
<p class="usageindented">You can filter or restrict the jots that are displayed to subsets of all your jots. You can filter
based on title (OK, Actually that's not there yet), tags, or date ranges.</p>
<p class="usageindented">To filter by tags...</p>
<p class="usageindented">To filter by date ranges...</p>
<p class="usageindented">To filter by title...</p>

<h1 class="usage">Understanding where jots, tags and filters are stored.</h1>
  <p class="usageindented">Jots are stored remotely, using either a Dropbox or Google Drive account. They might also be stored locally
  if the remote storage service is not available and will be pushed to it when it becomes available. Assuming you are connected
  though they will be stored or deleted in more or less real time.</p>
  <p class="usageindented">Your tags are also stored remotely. This means that all your tags are available regardless of what device or browswer you are currently using Thought Jot on.</p>
  <p class="usageindented">Your filter settings are stored locally, specific to the device you are on and the browser brand you are using. When you end a Thought Jot session the state of your filters are stored locally and when you come back to the same device and using the same browswer, the filter state will be restored to what it was previously. This means you could be working on one subset of your jots on one device (or browser) and another subset of your jots on another device or browser. But all the jots can be viewed on either device or browser just by turning all filtering off.</p>

<h1 class="usage">How Thought Jot works</h1>
<p class="usageindented">Thought Jot uses HTML5 IndexedDB for its local storage and the NimbusBase library to facilitate storage
and retrieval of jots and tags from your remote storage provider.</p>
